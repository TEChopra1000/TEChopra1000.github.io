								<p>Hello, my name is Talia Chopra and I am interested in using 
									machine learning and AI to improve business decision making, solve problems, and explore data.</p>
								<p>I have worked on challenging technical problems and used AI, machine learning, and computer
									vision to solve them. I am a strong and versatile programmer and a quick and independent learner.</p>
								<p>I have experience working in small and large companies and with multiple fast paced teams. I've helped launch new
									projects at an organizational level to improve customers acquisition and retention and to collect better metrics on website performance. 
									I've participated in interviews and helped onboard and mentor new hires. I am a
									positive person and I believe that caring for the customer is the first step in designing good products for them.

							<h2>Education Background</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I
							received a B.A. in Economics, Summa Cum Laude with Highest Honors in the Major as well as a minor in Mathematics. 
						</p>
						<p>I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Sciences from Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) 
							with a specialization in Machine Learning. I am a part-time student, and all of my classes are remote and 
							so I am able to work full time in the San Francisco Bay Area as I complete this degree. I am on track to graduate
							in the summer of 2022.
						</p>
						
						<h2>Work Experience</h2>
						<p>As an AI/ML technical writer at AWS I work with multiple teams to create technical documentation and 
							tutorials for customers using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker</a>.
							In my work, I regularly use AWS services including but not limited to Amazon S3, SageMaker, IAM, Textract and Rekognition.</p> 
							<p>I have co-authored a number of blog posts about new AWS AI/ML products and features that can be found <a href="blog.html">here</a>.</p>
						</p>
						<p>Before working at AWS, I worked as a Lead of Business Development in a boutique real estate brokerage in Santa Cruz, CA. 
							I helped created automated systems for lead acquisition and increased the volume of leads in our sales funnel by 3x. </p>
							
						<h2>Positions I'm Seeking</h2>
						<p>I am currently seeking full-time entry-level software engineering positions. I am able to work remotely, or on-site in the 
							San Francisco Bay Area.
