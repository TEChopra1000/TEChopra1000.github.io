							<h2>Education Background</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I
							received a B.A. in Economics, Summa Cum Laude with Highest Honors in the Major as well as a minor in Mathematics. 
						</p>
						<p>I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Sciences from Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) 
							with a specialization in Machine Learning. I am a part-time student, and all of my classes are remote and 
							so I am able to work full time in the San Francisco Bay Area as I complete this degree.
						</p>
						<p>Academically, I am interested in studying the different types of inferences that can be deduced from statistical
							analysis and from data science such as machine learning and deep learning. Practically, I am interested in
							programming machines to make inferences using machine learning and deep learning for programmatic decision making and
							improvements in automation.
						</p>
						<h2>Work Experience</h2>
						<p>As an AI/ML technical writer at AWS I write about new products that use Machine and Deep Learning.
							I mostly work on documentation for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker</a> and 
							<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai">Amazon Augmented AI</a>. 
							<p>In this position, I both write technical	documentation and create code-examples for customers using tools 
								like Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use products. I have also co-authored a number of blog
								posts about new AWS AI/ML products that can be found <a href="blog.html">here</a>.</p>
						</p>
						<p>Before working at AWS, I worked as a Lead of Business Development in a boutique real estate brokerage in Santa Cruz, CA. 
							I helped created automated systems for lead acquisition and increased the volume of leads in our sales funnel by 3x. 
							Subsequently, the number of sales at the firm increased by 2x. 
						</p>
						<h2>Positions I'm Seeking</h2>
						<p>I am currently seeking full-time entry-level ML software engineering positions. I am able to work remotely, or on-site in the 
							San Francisco Bay Area.
