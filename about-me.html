						 <h3>Business Development Lead at Schneider Estates, Inc</h3>
						<p>Before working at AWS, I worked as a lead of business development in a boutique real estate brokerage in Santa Cruz, CA. 
							I helped created automated systems for lead acquisition and increased the volume of leads in our sales funnel by 3x. </p>
